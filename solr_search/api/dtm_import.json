HIGHLIGHTS ROUND II\t\n1.1 Mobility1.2 Access to Basic Services at\nCollective IDP camps\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  In  87  (73%)  assessed  settlements,  shelter \nwas identified as the most needed humanitarian \nsupport. Repair materials for shelter specifically \nplastic sheeting was the most needed in Borama \n(100%),  Belet  Weyne  (86.1%),  Balcad  (75%) \nfollowed by Safe cooking facilities at collective \nsettlements (73 settlements).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  22  (18.4%)  settlements  mainly  in  Borama, \nDoolow and Afmadow had less than 7.5 litres of \nwater per person which is the minimum \namount of water in emergency settings, while \n41  (34%)  settlements  in  Balcad,  Belet Weyne, \nJowhar and Kismayo had access to between 10 \nand 15 litres per person per day.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  57  (47.8%)  collective  IDP  settlements  out  of \n119 had no access to health facilities. In 33 \n(27.7%)  settlements,  the  health  facilities  were \nWithin 3km from the settlement.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  In  44  (36.9%)  collective  IDP  sites,  key \ninformants reported that the settlements had \nno access to formal education for children. 83% \nin  Balcad,  75%  in  Afmadow,  63.8%  in  Belet \nWeyene. The key informants from the 40 \n(33.6%)  settlements  in  Kismayo  indicated  that \n75% of the settlements had access to education \nfor children.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  75  (63%)  settlements  (40  in  Kismayo,  15  in \nBalcad and 12 in Jowhar) reported that they did \nnot have access to any form of food distribution.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  106  (89%)  settlements  (Afmadow,  Borama, \nJowhar & Kismayo) reported existence of some \nform  of  security  mechanism,  while  13  (11%) \nsettlements assessed (Balcad, Belet Weyne & \nDoolow) did not have security in settlements.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 In 97 (81.5%) settlements, the main income\ngenerating activity was casual labour mainly in \nBelet Weyne, Borama, Dolloow, Jowhar and \nKismayo.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 In 12 (10%) settlements, farming was the \nmain source of income (mainly in Balcad)\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Collection of firewood was the main\nincome generating source in Afmadow.\t\nIDP settlements\nassessed\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  Out of 181 collective sites assessed in round 1,\nDTM round II assessed  119 sites. Round II\nfocused on information on primary needs of IDPs,\nlocations of origin and movement patterns.\t\nIndividual IDPs\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 149,819  IDPs (54%) or 26,205 HH were\nidentified out of  275,478 from collective IDP\nsettlements in 7 districts (Afmadow, Balcad, Belet\nWeyne, Boroma, Jowhar and Kismayo).\t\nCommunity\nOwned\nSettlements\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 55  IDP collective sites were on community\nowned land; 47 settlements were on public \nowned land; 13 settlements were on privately \nowned land.\t\nAre under 17yrs\nof age\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2  93,721  from all sites were below the age of \n17.  47,388  individuals were between 18 - 59 \nyears, representing 31.6%.\t\nHave Site\nmanagement\t\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Most IDP settlements  (118) had a site \nmanagement committee.\t\nDisplaced within\nsame region\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 119,106  (79.5%) of the IDP population were \ndisplaced from other districts within the region. \n30,713  were IDPs from other regions.\nBalcad, Beletweyne, Boroma and Jowhar had\nthe highest number of IDPs displaced within\nthe respective regions. While Doolow and\nKismayo had the highest number of IDPs\ndisplaced whose place of origin was outside\ntheir current region of residence\t\nWere willing to\nreturn to their\nplaces of origin\t\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 79.5%  of IDPs were willing to go back to their\nplace of origin if security and livelihood\/\nfood situations improved. 19.5%  intended to\nbe integrated within the local community. In\nKismayo, Afmadow and Belet Weyne, safety and\nsecurity at their place of origin was the main\nreason preventing their return. In Borama and\nDoolow lack of livelihood opportunities was the\nmain deterring factor.\t\n* Borama had only one site assessed compared to Kismayo (40) Belet Weyne (36)\nBalcad (15) Doolow (5) and Afmadow (4) sites regarding to any % estimate\nShelter\/NFI: \nWash: \nHealth: \nEducation: \nFood\/Cash Vouchers: \nProtection: \nLivelihood: \n119 \n149,819 \n55 \n62.6% \n118 \n119,106 \n\u00036\u00038\u0002\u00f7\u00034\u0003J\n\nDisplacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is an information management tool developed by the International Organization\nfor Migration (IOM) to gather baseline information on displaced populations, conditions in the areas in which they have \ntemporary settled and monitor trends over time. DTM has been rolled out in over 27 countries, Somalia being the 28th \ncountry. Some of the 27 countries include Iraq, Syria, and South Sudan.\nThe second round of data collection for the DTM pilot project in Somalia was carried between 13th June and 27th June \n2016 in five regions (Awdal, Hiraan, Middle Shabelle, Lower Juba and Gedo) in seven districts (Afmadow, Borama, \nKismayo, Doolow, Balcad, Belet Weyne and Jowhar). Out of 181 settlements identified in round 1, round 2 captured data \nfrom 119 settlements covering a total of 149,819. The reasons for fewer sites being assessed in round 2 were because \nthe sites selected had higher number of IDP per site and would therefore be more representative in identifying sectoral \nneeds.   However, the data and analysis presented is a representative sample, being 66% of those assessed in round 1) of \nthe total number. Collective sites were defined as any site comprising a minimum of five IDP households that were \nidentified in round 1.\nThe objective of the second round was to identify sectorial gaps to inform government, donors and partners working in \nSomalia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IDP settlements. DTM is implemented by IOM Somalia in partnership with the Federal Government of Somalia \nand is made possible by the generous support of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations \n(ECHO) and Government of Japan.   \nIOM is currently carrying out a flow monitoring and a rapid response assessment. Flow Monitoring is used to track\nmovement of displaced and mobile populations at key points of origin, transit, or destination. Flow monitoring is ongoing \nin Belethawa, Doolow and El wark. The Rapid Response Assessment is an alert report used to collect the most essential \ndata required for operation planning purposes. The rapid response is being carried out in the drought affected areas in \nPuntland. The reports capturing flow monitoring or population movement trends and the rapid response assessment will \nbe shared once finalized.\t\n3.  METHODOLOGY\t\nThe site assessments were undertaken in 181 identified IDP collective sites from round one. The sites were selected\nfor the assessment based on their accessibility and if they were not located within host communities where less than five \nIDP household either rented accommodation or resided with host families. The objective was to capture detailed \ninformation on key services available and flag out issues that require attention. Data collection was undertaken using \npaper forms (Site assessment forms) which were utilized to record data such as location, name of site, size and type of \nsite, details of site management agency if present and any gaps in the site. The form also captured details on estimated \nIDP population, their place of origin and demographic information such as number of households by age and sex.\nFurthermore, sectoral gaps in: WASH, shelter and NFI, food, nutrition, health, education, livelihood, communication, and \nprotection were identified. Data was collected through key informants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interviews (KII) and focus group discussions \n(FGDs) with IDPs representatives and local authorities. The FDG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in each site had an average seven participants.  \nDemographic data presented in this report is based on an aggregate estimate of the focus group discussions conducted. \nTherefore, In an IDP collective site of 1,200 individuals, typically, 10% would have been directly consulted and aggregate \ndata derived from the total population estimate for the site.\nThereafter, the data was cleaned and uploaded on the server using an application called KOBO which is installed in the \nmobile phones. Enumerators were trained by the Team leaders on how to use KOBO to collect primary data.\t\n4. DISPLACEMENT OVERVIEW\t\nIt is currently estimated that 1.1 million individuals currently live in displacement in Somalia. Recognizing that it is\ngenerally accepted that this figure needs to be reviewed, the total number enumerated during DTM round 1\nrepresents 39% of the total (430,062 individuals) and excludes the caseload residing in Mogadishu. \nOf these, 275,478 IDPs lived in 181 collective IDP settlements. In DTM round two, data was collected from 119 \nsettlements (149,819 IDPs) out of the 181 settlements identified in round one. On average, each site had about \n1,259 individuals. (Table 4a)\t\n2.

Spontaneous \nsettlements were defined as  sites that are unplanned and spontane-\nously occupied by the displaced population.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 With a total of 40, Kismayo currently has the highest number of\nspontaneous collective sites, of the total surveyed by DTM. All 18\ncollective sites in Balacad were planned. Planned sites had basic\nshelter and communal infrastructure to host displaced populations.\n4.2 Land Ownership\nMost of the settlements (55) were on ancestral land. 47 settlements \nwere on public land, 13 settlements were on privately owned land. The \nownership of land at 4 settlements was unknown. For the ancestral \nland, IDPs laid claim to the land based on their ancestral links to the \nlocation. In other instances, the local administration allocated land for \nthe IDPs. In the assessed sites, evictions were only anticipated if IDPs \nsettled claimed resided on private farmland, where the owner would \nseek eviction from the local administration for future plans of \ncultivation. The IDP site leaders reported that evictions were unlikely \nand did not anticipate evictions in the near future.\t\n4.3 Site Management\t\nAll the IDP settlements had some form of management committees \non site which were identified as being responsible for coordinating site\nactivities and conflict resolution. The site management committee\n(SMC) were elected by the IDP community with the support of local\nadministration. Where present, the SMCs serve as the principle\ncoordination mechanisms for organizations and other stakeholders\nproviding assistance in the settlements. The type  and impact of  SMCs \nneeds to be  verified in future assessments.\n5.1 Demographic\nBelet weyne district had 30% (44,331) IDPs) which was the highest\nnumber of IDPs assessed in round two, followed by Jowhar 22%\n(32,547 IDPs) while Afmadow district had the lowest number of\nIDPs 3% (3,727). There were more female 55% (82,725) IDPs\ncompared to males 45% (67,094). Assessment teams indicated that\nthe higher proportion of females over males is due to the latter\nleaving the settlements, in higher numbers, to seek livelihoods \nelsewhere, as well as some joining militia groups.\t\n5.

Borama and\nBalcad had the highest number of IDPs within the\nsame region. Kismayo and Doolow are hosting a \nhigher proportion of IDPs displaced from other \nregions (6.2% and 11.6% respectively) when compared \nto Awdal, Hirran and Middle Shabelle.\nDuring the assessment IDPs were asked about their\nintentions to return to their place of origin. 79.5% of\nIDPs expressed interest to return to their place of origin,\nthis was contingent on improvements in the security\nsituation and livelihood opportunities, 19.5% didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want\nto move, 1.1% wanted to relocate outside the country\nand 0.4% expressed interest in settling in the nearest\nvillage\nTable 5. 2: Total IDP population in collective IDP camps by age\nChart 5. 3: Camp Summary on primary & secondary displacement\nChart 6. 1: Region of origin\nChart 6. 2: Return Intentions of displaced populations\n5.2  Breakdown by Age in IDP camps\nChildren below 17 accounted for 63% (93,721) of the\ntotal population of IDPs in the settlements.

Damaged basic infrastructure was reported in\nJowhar and Belet Weyne as the second barrier\nhindering their return.\nDuring the assessment, interviewees were requested to list\nin priority order the most needed Non-Food Items. Plastic\nsheeting was identified as the most needed NFI in 7 of the\ndistricts assessed. In Borama, 100% of respondents\nindicated plastic sheeting as a first priority, in Belet Weyne;\n86.1%, Kismayo; 85%, Balcad: 75% and Doolow: 60%).\nIn Afmadow, 75% of respondents cited blankets as the most\nrequired NFI. Mosquito nets were the 2nd most needed\nNFI in all the districts with exception of Borama where\nblankets were the 2nd most needed NFI.

In order to enhance the \nanalysis  of  these  displacement  movements,  Figure  2  below  includes  another  observation  period  by  separating  the  dis-\nplacement  after  August  1  in  two  components:  the  first  from  1  to  31  August;  and  the  second  from  September  1  to  date. \nThis analysis supports capturing the impacts of the latest displacements (e.g. after 1 September) across Iraq and does not \nintend to categorize a new major wave across the country as it occurred over a larger timespan (e.g. three\t-month period).\t \t\n \nFigure 2 provides a different visual interpretation of the four displacement periods identified namely: pre June; June \/ July\t; \t\nAugust;  and  September  1  to  present.

The  main  governorates  of  displacement  are  within  Anbar \n(66%  or  313,536  individuals),  to  Baghdad  (12%  or  56,736  individuals),  and  the  Kurdistan  Region  of  Iraq  (15%  or \n72,804 individuals). Anbar was the main governorate affected by the hostilities thus reporting the highest rates of dis-\nplacement.   \t \t\n \t\n\u00ef\u0080\u00aa \tBetween  June  and  July,  the  conflict  expanded  to  the  governorates  of  Ninewa,  Salah  al\t-Din,  and  Diyala  causing  the \t\ndisplacement of 183,864 (39%), 175,578 (37%), and 48,756 (10%) individuals respectively, out of the total 474,636 \nindividuals displaced during this period. The majority of the population fled to Erbil (17% or 82,668 individuals), Kirkuk \n(16%  or  73,944  individuals),  Najaf  (15%  or  70,674  individuals),  and  Sulaymaniyah  (11%  or  51,300  individuals).  The \nimpacts of these displacement movements were widespread, affecting an even greater number of governorates.   \t \t\n \t\n\u00ef\u0080\u00aa \tDuring  the  month  of  August,  138,634  families  (831,804  individuals)  fled  as  AGs  expanded  their  operations  into  the \nSinjar area of Ninewa governorate. In fact, 85% of this population (708,054 individuals) were displaced from Ninewa \nand 6% (46,632 individuals) from Salah al\t-Din. The main receiving governorates where Dahuk, hosting 407,526 indi-\t\nviduals  (49%),  and  Erbil  (10%  or  79,356  individuals).  Also,  18%  (145,602  individuals)  of  this  population  were \tdis-\t\nplaced within Ninewa. This phase of the crisis was the shortest and the most intense, drastically influencing the entire \nhumanitarian response strategy.\t \t\n \t\n\u00ef\u0080\u00aa \tFrom September 1 to date, 36,661 families (219,966 individuals) have been displaced. While this figure is compara-\ntively  smaller  than  other  major  waves  and  took  place  over  a  three\t-month  period,  it  is  noteworthy  to  highlight  that \t\nthese displacements were provoked by a series of distinct but concurrent crises that have broken out in several gov-\nernorates.

The Ninewa governorate districts of Akre and Al Shikhan \nreceived  136,068  individuals.  These  six  districts  in  Northern  Iraq  now  host  28%  of  the  overall  displaced  individuals.  The \nwestern governorate of Anbar hosts the second largest population (19%) of displaced with 374,154 individuals.  \t \t\n \nFrom a regional perspective\t4, the entire Kurdistan Region of Iraq (including the districts of Akre, Al Shikhan, in Ninewa gov-\t\nernorate;  and  Kifri  and  Khanaqin,  in  Diyala  governorate)  hosts  47%  of  the  total  displaced  populations,  an  estimated \n946,266  individuals;  45%  are  reported  in  the  Central  region, \testimated  904,170  individuals\t5;  while  8%  of  the  overall  caseload \t\nhave sought refuge in the south, 153,630 individuals.\t \t\n \nThe  governorates  with  the  greatest  population  fleeing  their  homes  continue  to  be  Ninewa  with  943,962  individuals  and \nAnbar with 540,732 individuals. \t \t\n4The  Kurdistan  Region  includes  the  governorates  of:  Dahuk,  Sulaymaniyah,  and  Erbil.  The  South  Region  includes:  Basrah; Qadissiya; Missan, Najaf, Thi\t\u00e2\u0080\u0090Qar, and Wassit.

High rates of \t\nintra\t-governorate  displacements  are  reported  as  a  consequence  to  restricted  movements  and  tight  border  regulations \t\nbetween governorates, or following localized conflict  that caused populations to displace to neighboring districts. Family \nand tribal connections coupled with broader ethnic and religious affiliations are also factors that are reported to determine\t \t\nwhether IDPs displace within their original governorates or seek protection in other governorates.\t \t\nThrough the reporting period (9 to 25 November) DTM field staff recorded an additional 35,550 displaced individuals. \t \t\n \nCentral Region\t \t\nThrough November, ongoing clashes in the area of Al Alam in the district of Tikrit, Salah al\t-Din, have caused many fami-\t\nlies  to  flee  the  area,  adding  further  fluidity  to  the  displacement  movements  in  the  region.  To  date,  DTM  identified  that  a \nlarge portion of this group have fled to the neighboring governorate of Kirkuk, with more than 4,500 IDP individuals in the \nsub\t-district of Kirkuk Centre. In Salah al\t-Din, decreasing IDP figures were monitored in the districts of Tikrit (2,142 individ-\t\nuals) and Baiji (624 individuals), while an increase of 1,800 individuals was observed in the district of Samarra. However, \t\nthe size of the displaced populations is believed to be larger in Kirkuk, Salah al\t-Din, Baghdad and Babylon. DTM will con-\t\ntinue  to  track  and  monitor the  IDP  movement  from  Al  Alam  which  is  not  yet  fully  identified  due  to  access  limitations  and \nthe difficultly of tracking families who have not yet been registered.\t \t\n \nThe governorate of Diyala has witnessed an increase of 4,434 individuals in the area of Ba\u00e2\u0080\u0099quba as clashes persist and \npeople continue to move within the governorate in search of safer areas.\t \t\n \nSouth Region\t  \t\nDisplacement to the southern governorates of Iraq continues, although the number of displaced remains relatively small, \nwith an additional 2,244 individuals seeking refuge predominantly in the governorates of Basrah (40%), and Najaf (32%). \nThis group originates from Ninewa (72% of the increase in the south), followed by Anbar (10%), Salah Al\t-din (10) and Kir-\t\nkuk (9%). \t \t\nThe displaced populations across Iraq have sought refuge within a range of shelter types. Many areas have become bur-\ndened with large displaced populations and the increased demand for shelter. As a result, a large number of families are \nhoused  in  inadequate  and  short\t-term  shelter  arrangements  that  are  unsuitable  for  winter  weather  conditions.  This  be-\t\ncomes particularly concerning in the governorates hosting the largest displaced populations. \t \t\n \nPeople of concern are those who have found refuge in more vulnerable shelter arrangements and are not hosted or living \nin hotels or rented accommodations.  Figure 5 shows the total population by governorate currently housed in critical shel-\nter  arrangements  (such  as  informal  settlements,  religious  buildings,  schools,  and  unfinished  buildings)  in  comparison  to \nthe population staying in camps and in private settings (rented houses, hotels, and with host community).\n\n8\t \t\nIOM Response to the IDP Crisis in Iraq \t\u00ef\u0082\u009f 2014\t \t \tDecember 2014\t \t\nCONTACT\t \t IOM IRAQ \t \t \t\u00ef\u0080\u00aa iraqdtm@iom.int\t \t\n \t\nFigure 5: \tShelter arrangement of IDP families in 2014.\t \t\nStaying with host families or within hotels remains the most common arrangement for IDPs across Iraq as 1,162,644 indi-\nviduals  (58%)  are  currently  housed  within  these  shelter  types;  however,  a  significant  proportion  of  the  overall  IDP  case-\nload, 34% (an estimated 674,376 individuals), have sought refuge in critical shelter arrangements.\t \t\n \nFrom the critical shelter types occupied, unfinished buildings are the most common with 302,316 individuals (15%).

Overall, the majority of displacement was \nwithin Anbar governorate with smaller displaced \npopulations fleeing to bordering governorates including \nBaghdad and Salah al \u00e2\u0080\u0090Din.

Dtm has been rolled out in over 30 countries including \nhaiti, pakistan, mali, the philippines, and south sudan. Dtm was first implemented in Iraq in 2006 to track \nthe movements of internally displaced people (IDps) during the wave of sectarian violence.\nsince late December 2013, tens of thousands of families have fled their homes in anbar governorate, \nwhere recent clashes between militant groups and Iraqi security Forces have destabilized the area. In \ncoordination with the united Nations humanitarian Country team (hCt ), the Iraqi ministry of migration and \nDisplacement (momD) and other stakeholders, IOm Iraq is implementing Dtm to support the overall efforts \nof the hCt as outlined in the 2014 Iraq strategic response plan (srp). the srp addresses the coordinated \nresponse of hCt partners to the anbar Crisis for a six month period, beginning in February 2014 and ending \nin July 2014. after each month of Dtm implementation there is a period for evaluation to allow for continual \nimprovement. Dtm is a flexible instrument, adaptable to diverse situations, changing information needs, \nand external feedback.\nthe u.s. state Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bureau of population, refugees, and migration (prm) has provided initial \nfunding for Dtm through the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cemergency response addressing Iraqi Internally Displaced persons \n(IDps) from violence Originating in anbar governorate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Continued donor support of Dtm is essential in the \ndesign of an appropriate humanitarian response that will meet the evolving needs of IDps and population \naffected by the crisis. therefore, IOm continues to share up-to-date information with interested parties and \npursue additional donor partnerships to enable the mission to obtain full funding for Dtm. \nIn addition to Dtm, IOm plays a pivotal role as co-lead of the shelter and Non-Food Item (NFI) cluster, \ncontinuing to distribute emergency relief supplies to those most in need throughout the country. since \nJanuary 2014, the mission has delivered 7,507 NFI kits to the most vulnerable of anbar Crisis IDps across \n9 governorates. as a trusted distributing partner IOm Iraq has also facilitated the distribution of 12,756 \nindividual food parcels on behalf of the world Food program (wFp) to IDp families identified as food \ninsecure within the governorate of anbar. \nthe methodology of Dtm in Iraq has been two-fold; the first stage involves the identification of displaced \npopulations through a network of community-level key informants (KIs), momD registration data, and \ninformation provided by other agencies. In the second stage locations are validated, assessed, and profiled \nto gain a detailed understanding of the situation for IDps. the process of identifying, validating, and \nassessing locations will be cyclical, lasting one month, in order to best track the continued movements \nand overall trends of the displaced population at the location (site) level and the governorate level, as the \nsituation evolves.\n2\nDtm round II (april 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\nrepOrt prODuCeD By IOm IN COOrDINatION wIth the \nINter-Cluster COOrDINatION meChaNIsm (ICCm)\n\nbackground\nIn each successive month of implementation, the two-stage process will continue; new locations identified \nas hosting IDps will be documented, and all or a sample of identified sites (both new and those from \nprevious rounds) will be (re)assessed. a s displacement sites are assessed, IOm staff continually work to \nimprove the utility of the information gathered. a s a recent amendment to Dtm methodology, IOm Iraq \nnow provides a confidence rating to each location profile.  the data is rated on numerous factors including \nthe number of KIs utilized, discrepancies between information received, accessibility of location, and the \nability to personally validate the information received.  \nIn the first month of D tm implementation, IOm identified a total of 66,184 IDp families across Iraq in 585 \nlocations.  the majority of the IDp s were displaced within a nbar; however, due to security concerns, it was \nnot possible to validate or fully assess these identified locations. In the past month, displacement due \nto the a nbar Crisis has continued and IOm has identified a total of 74,010 IDp families in 814 locations \nnationwide.  the majority of the identified population still resides in a nbar; 47,648 IDp families are hosted in \n207 sites.  throughout a pril IOm field monitors were able to validate and assess a total of 449 sites, covering \n45,927 IDp families (264,347 individuals), which included 132 reassessments of identified locations from the \npreceding month. Of the 449 assessed sites, 50 locations are within a nbar because access has improved.  \nD tm endeavors to become a comprehensive information source and an effective monitoring tool; however, \naccess limitations must be considered alongside the complex and fluid nature of the displacement seen in \nIraq today.  the cyclical methodology of D tm caters to these constraints and D tm will provide a monthly \nsnapshot of displacement sites and populations throughout Iraq. IOm continually strives to increase D tm \ncoverage through each successive month where the security situation permits. \nt his report presents the findings for the second month of D tm for the crisis in anbar, conducted in a pril \n2014.

IOm has, however, identified over 680 families displaced due to flooding in Fallujahh and abu ghraib that have sought refuge in the more distant districts of al-rutba, \nhaditha and heet, still within the governorate of anbar.  Others \nfrom within anbar have been forced further still to governorate of \nsalah al-Din where over 230 families are currently located in the \ndistricts of al-Dour and samarra.\nthe flood waters have caused extensive damage to agricultural \nland and the death of significant numbers of livestock, and there \nhave been reports indicating an increase in food prices, particularly \nmeat and vegetables. many of the families who were forced to \nleave their properties, land, and livestock have lost their financial \nresources and ability to secure an income. most displaced families \nare currently living with their relatives, often 3 to 5 families per \nhousehold, and therefore have to cope with a lack of supplies and \nother household items; IDp families are in urgent need of shelter, \nnon-food items, food items, water tanks, hygiene kits, toilets and \nhealth care.\n\nMigration trends\nIDeNtIFIeD aNBar CrIsIs IDps aND  lOC atIONs\nOver the last 4 months, more than 400,000 people have fled ongoing violence in the Iraqi governorate \nof a nbar. IOm has been able to identify 74,010 families in 814 different locations throughout Iraq.  the \nvast majority of internally displaced people (IDp s) have displaced within their district of anbar, whether \nthat be from r amadi or Fallujah, from which nearly all IDp s originate. therefore, 64.4% of identfied IDp s \nare located within a nbar, followed by Baghdad with 13.4%, s alah al-Din with 7.2% of IDps, sulaymaniyah \n(4.5%), and erbil (4.3%).

Notably, as indicated by the chart above, \nthe identification of new anbar Crisis IDp families has slowed considerably; just under 8,000 families were \nnewly identified by IOm in the last month. In 64% of the sites assessed, the majority of anbar Crisis IDps in \nthe location had fled the governorate in January.  the majority of IDps in 27% of sites had fled in February. \nIn all sites assessed in anbar, the majority of IDps intended to return to their place of origin when the \nsituation allowed. IDps wished to return in 72% of sites assessed outside of anbar, while in 23% of sites \nthey were waiting on one or more factors to decide. \nInterestingly, the percentage of those who wish to return is the same whether the family is from ramadi or \nFallujahh.  also notable were the 4 sites in Bablyon, 3 in Najaf, and 1 in thi Qar where the majority of anbar \nCrisis IDps wished to integrate locally, most likely due to the presence of family in the location where \nIDps have chosen to settle.  In 4 sites in salah al-Din governorate, the majority of anbar IDps planned \nto resettle in a third location. this \nmay be indicative of the poor living \nconditions that families are facing in \nthis governorate.\t\ntOtal FamIlIes\n31,191 45,674 66,184\n74,010\n\nMigration trends\t\n7\tDtm round II (april 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\nprImary mOvemeNts OF \nassesseD aNBar CrIsIs IDps\t\n24%\n26% 37%\n37%\t\n38% displaced within ramadi\t\n38%\t\n26% displaced elsewhere in \nanbar\n37% displaced elsewhere in \nIraq 37% displaced within Fallujah\nFallujah mOvemeNts\t\nramaDI mOvemeNts\t\n38% displaced elsewhere in \nIraq\n24% displaced elsewhere in \nanbar\t\n38%\t\nsimilar to the findings of the Dtm in march 2014, \nIDps have nearly all originated from Fallujah and \nramadi districts of anbar, with less significant \nnumbers of IDps from al-Qa\u00e2\u0080\u0099im, al-rutba, and ana \ndistricts.  singularly, Fallujah district hosts a larger \nnumber of IDp families than any other district of \nanbar or other governorate of Iraq with more \nthan 16,000 identified families, the vast majority \nof which are from elsewhere in the district. the \nheet district of anbar hosts 28% of identified IDps \ndisplaced in anbar while ramadi has 16%, al-\nrutba 8%, and the other districts combined have \n14%.  huge numbers of IDps displaced within \ntheir district of origin. \t\nCurreNt \nDIstrICt Identified IDp \nFamilies % of Identified \nIDp Families \nwithin anbar\nFallujah 16163 34%\nheet 13227 28%\nramadi 772716%\nal-rutba 3695 8%\nhaditha 2313 5%\nal-Qa\u00e2\u0080\u0099im 1854 4%\nana 1419 3%\nra\u00e2\u0080\u0099ua 1250 2%\naNBar 47648 100%\n\nMigration trends\t\n8\tDtm r ound II ( april 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\t\nCurreNt \nl OC atION DIstrIC\nt OF OrIgIN IN aNBar\ntO tal \nassesseD \nIDp F amIlIes\nFallujah\nramadi al-Qa\u00e2\u0080\u0099im al-rutba ana\nFallujah 11579929120 80-12708\nr amadi\n2255409 ---5634\nheet 63481823 ---8171\na l-rutba\n1513766 ---2279\nana 19765 ---262\naNBar 198628992 120 80-29054\nBabylon 124133 ---257\nBaghdad 26512852 --53 5556\nBasrah 31 -1 - 5\nDahuk 43356 ---489\nDiyala 7515 --- 90\nerbil 2321893 ---3214\nKerbala 58611 ---597\nKirkuk 937-- --937\nm issan 11 --- 2\nNajaf 10123 ---124\nNinewa 3310 --- 43\nQadissiya 2911 --- 40\ns alah al-Din 1970234 ---2204\nsulaymaniyah 21101165 ---3275\nt hi Qar 221--- 23\nw assit 152--- 17\nOutsIDe aNBar 114115408 -15316873\nIra Q-wIDe 3127314400 120815345927\n77 sites assessed (17%) were in rural settings, 15 of which were in a\nnbar governorate. these sites held \n8,032 families or 17% of the total population of IDp s assessed. urban locations made up 70% of sites \nassessed, but held 77% of IDp s assessed. semi-urban sites made up the remainder. \nFor a pril, most governorates reported a stabilization or decrease in the rate of IDp arrivals from the a nbar \nCrisis. \na nbar Crisis IDp s have been moving internally within their governorate of displacement, particularly in \nKerbala, erbil, and  thi Qar, primarily to search for more affordable housing options. a s well, some of the \nIDp s who had initially displaced to s alah al-Din and sulaymaniyah were identified in Kirkuk, having moved \nagain due to high living costs and rent prices in these areas. s econdary displacements were also noted in \nerbil; large numbers of a nbar Crisis IDps who fled anbar to the governorate have moved to neighboring \ngovernorates or internally to more rural, cheaper areas of erbil. It has been reported that these migrations \nwere purely for economic reasons, associated with the depletion of cash resources.\nQuite notably, there were reports from Kirkuk, Baghdad, and Diyala of small a nbar Crisis IDp families \nreturning to their areas of origin due to increased stability in the specific area or neighborhood from \nwhich they had displaced.\n\ndeMographics\t\nages 0-5ages 6-14 ages 15-24\nages 25-59\nages 60+\n11%\n17% 25% 38%9%\t}\t\n53%\t\nassesseD aNBar CrIsIs IDps By age grOup\t\nmOst COmmON \nvulNeraBIlItIes \namONg aNBar IDps \nIN sItes assesseD\nChIlD at rIsK\t\nassessed locations revealed a wide range of age demographics, from \ninfants to elders; however, the majority of IDps assessed were under \nthe age of 25. significant minorities of infants of 5 years or below \n(11%) and adults of 60 years or more (9%) must be considered due \nto the vulnerability of these age groups. the average family size for \nthose IDp families assessed was from 5 to 6 members. similar to the \nDtm findings from march, in 51% of the assessed sites the primary \nethnicity and religion of the host community residents matched that \nof the ethnicity and religion of the new anbar Crisis IDps. \nIOm identified over 72,000 vulnerabilities among the anbar Crisis IDp \npopulation. as one individual may have multiple vulnerabilities, the \nnumber of individuals suffering from these identified vulnerabilities is \nunknown. however, the prevalence of vulnerability can be compared \nto the number of sites where the vulnerability was identified.

In the governorates of Baghdad, Kerbala, and s alah al-Din, however, a significant minority of \nthe assessed sites (42%, 40% and 33% respectively) reported that housing for IDp s was in poor condition. \nw ithin the assessed sites outside of a nbar, it was commonly reported that stable housing options were \nthe main shelter support needed, which is intimately connected with financial assistance. s econd to these \nneeds were household items such as bedding and cooking utensils.

In Kerbala, documentation \nissues, financial conditions, and the long distance to schools were more commonly cited.

the first stage involves the identification \nof displaced populations, through a network \nof community-level key informants (KI), m omD \nregistration data, and information provided by \nother agencies. In the second stage, locations are \nvalidated, assessed, and profiled to gain a detailed \nunderstanding of the situation for IDp s. the process \nof identifying, validating, and assessing locations \nwill be cyclical, lasting one to two months, in order \nto best track the continued movements and overall \ntrends of the displaced population at the location \nand the governorate level, as the situation evolves.\nIn each successive round of implementation, the \ntwo stage process will continue; new locations \nidentified as hosting IDp s will be documented, \nand all or a sample of identified sites (both new \nand those from previous rounds) will be (re)\nassessed. a s displacement sites are assessed, IOm \nstaff continually work to improve the utility of the \ninformation gathered.  with a newly introduced \namendment of the D tm methodology, IOm Iraq \nprovides a confidence rating to each location profile. \nt he data is rated on numerous factors including; \nthe number of KIs used, discrepancies between \ninformation received, accessibility of location, and \npersonal ability to validate the information received.  \nIn the first month of the D tm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation, \nm arch 2014, IOm identified a total of 66,184 IDp \nfamilies across Iraq in 585 locations.  the majority of \nthe IDp s were displaced within a nbar; however, due \nto security concerns, it was not possible to validate \nor fully assess these identified locations. In the \nsubsequent month, displacement due to the a nbar \nCrisis continued and IOm identified a total of 71,178 \nIDp families in 825 locations nationwide. a s the Dtm \ncontinued through a third month of assessment, \nIOm identified 79,810 IDp families in 840 locations. \nFrom the end of m ay, the majority of the identified \npopulation still resides in a nbar; 52,697 IDp families \nare hosted in 222 sites.  through m ay, IOm field \nmonitors were able to validate and access a total \nof 296 sites which included 125 reassessments of \nlocations from the preceding month. Inclusive of \nthese 296 assessed sites, 66 locations are within \na nbar governorate as access improved. \n3\nDtm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\n\nbACkgR ounD\nDue to difficulties enumerating families displaced \ndue to the flooding in a bu ghraib and Fallujah on \nthe smallest location level, the IDp figures from \nm ay by and large do not include those displaced \nin late a pril and m ay due to the flooding.   the \nhC t estimates that over 12,000 families have \ndisplaced from the flooding, while IOm field staff \nhave been able to identify the locations of more \nthan 7,000 families on the subdistrict level in 6 \ngovernorates of Iraq.  It should be noted that the \nfigures published throughout this report may not \nbe fully representative of the total IDp population, \nspecifically those displaced from the flooding.\nt he D tm endeavors to become a complete \ninformation source and an effective monitoring \ntool, however, access limitations must be \nconsidered alongside the complex and fluid \nnature of the displacement seen in Iraq today.  the \ncyclical methodology of the D tm caters for these \nconstraints and will provide a continual snapshot of \ndisplacement sites and populations throughout Iraq. \nIOm strives to increase the D tm coverage though \neach successive round of assessments where the  security situation permits. \nthe extent of the crisis has \nled to a steady increase in the number of identified \ndisplacement sites; due to this IOm will conduct \nthe upcoming round of assessments through a two \nmonth period (June and July), therefore the next \noverview report will be published at the end of July. \nt his will allow for better and extensive coverage of \ndisplaced sites, to present a representative picture \nof the needs of those displaced due to the a nbar \nCrisis. \nt his report presents the findings for the third month \nof the D tm for the crisis in a nbar, conducted in \nm ay 2014. In addition and as the D tm continues \nto accumulate data from previous rounds of \nassessment, this report has aggregated the data \nfrom assessments in a pril with the most recent \nassessments in m ay, where applicable.  this has \nallowed for analysis of a large sample and boosted \ncoverage to over 50% of identified sites within \na nbar and 78% of the identified sites outside of \na nbar.

In the 296 sites assessed in m\nay, IOm identified 751 families in erbil, Kerbala, s alah al-Din, wassit, \nand Baghdad who had displaced more than once since the a nbar Crisis began. the vast majority were \nlocated in Kerbala, a governorate bordering  anbar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fallujah district. 60 families had first displaced within \nFallujah for 5 weeks before coming to Kerbala, while the other 503 secondary displaced families lived \nelsewhere in Kerbala for 4-6 weeks before moving to their present location in the governorate.  67 families \nin shaqlawa district of erbil had first displaced for 1 week to elsewhere in the governorate before coming \nto shaqlawa, while 25 families in erbil district had most recently come from spending 1-3 weeks in either \nKarkh district of Baghdad or  tikrit district of s alah al-Din. 24 families had initially displaced to Kirkuk district \nof Kirkuk before coming to the  tikrit district of s alah al-Din, and 72 families first displaced to erbil district of \nerbil and spent 10-11 weeks there before recently settling in Karkh district of Baghdad. \nOverall IOm identified that 164 families had displaced twice since the beginning of the a nbar Crisis, while \n563 families had been displaced three times.  while the majority of families had spent 5 weeks in their \nprevious location of displacement, 25% of families had spent 1 month or less in their previous location, \nand 21% spent over 6 weeks in their first displacement.  this secondary displacement is indicative of the \ndifficult living conditions that a nbar Crisis IDps are facing during their displacement, forcing them to seek \nout better options elsewhere.\nIOm has identified 867 sites throughout Iraq that are currently holding or have hosted a nbar Crisis IDps; \nof these, 27 sites no longer host a nbar Crisis IDps due to secondary displacement; as a result there are \ncurrently 840 identified locations across Iraq that host a nbar Crisis IDps. Combined with the data collected \non secondary displaced IDp s, it can be concluded that \nsome IDp s are moving multiple times during their \ndisplacement to obtain better shelter, services, or \nsecurity. 8 locations in Baghdad (3 in a dhamia district, \n2 in a l resafa, 1 in a bu ghraib, 1 in Kadhimiya, and 1 in \nKarkh) were identified in a pril as having a total of 145 \nIDp families; in m ay, these 8 sites no longer contained \nany IDp families.  this trend was also noted in 6 sites \nin Bablyon (mostly in a l-mahawil district), 3 sites in \nDahuk (mostly in Zakho district), 3 sites in erbil (mostly \nin erbil district), as well as in 2 sites in Kerbala district \nof Kerbala. In total, 564 IDp families have completely \nvacated 27 sites as of  may 2014. \nOverall, 6 governorates have seen a decrease in \nthe number of identified IDp s between april and \nm ay: Babylon (30 less families), Baghdad (516 less), \nDiyala (11 less), Kerbala (122 less), Najaf (10 less), and \nQadissiya (3 less). a s it has been reported that families \nare not returning to their places of origin as the \nviolence continues in a nbar, it is assumed that these \nfamilies have begun a secondary displacement in \nanother area of Iraq. In Baghdad, the largest decrease \nwas seen in the governorate of a bu ghraib, which is \nto be expected considering the massive displacement \nin this district due to flooding. IOm, with further \namendments to the D tm methodology, plans to \nbetter track and map the secondary movements of \nIDp s as the a nbar Crisis continues.\n\nMIgRATIon TRenDS\t\n11\tDtm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\nIn may, the D tm expanded its questionnaire to include information on push and pull factors for a nbar \nCrisis IDp s. Of the assessed locations in m ay, 90% of the 296 locations stated that the primary reason that \na nbar Crisis IDp s in the location had displaced was generalized violence and armed conflict. Five percent \n(5%) of sites noted that IDp s had been evacuated or displaced by the government, and in 4% it was \nnoted that IDp s had displaced due to direct threats on the family. In the remaining 1% of sites, IDp s had \ndisplaced because a family member had been killed in the violence.  e vacuated IDps were concentrated \nin the a l-mahawil district of Babylon and were equally from Fallujah and r amadi districts of anbar, while \nIDp s displaced due to direct threats were nearly all from  ramadi district and had primarily fled to Karkh \ndistrict of Baghdad.  there did not appear to be a correlation between date of displacement and reason \nfor displacing. \nBy vast majority, a nbar Crisis IDps were attracted to their area of displacement due to good security and \nthe presence of family or friends in the location. In 46% of sites assessed in m ay, good security was seen \nas the primary pull factor for IDp s to the location, and in 43% of sites, the presence of family or friends was \nthe key attracting force. IDp s were attracted by good security primarily in Baghdad,  anbar, Dahuk,  erbil, \nand sulaymaniyah.  the presence of family or friends pulled IDp s to sites in anbar, Babylon, Baghdad, and \nNajaf. \npuSH  AnD pull f ACToRS\t\naNBar CrIsIs IDps \nhaD  DIspla CeD Due \ntO  geNeralIZeD  \nVIOleNCe  IN\n90%\nOF sItes assesseD aNBar CrIsIs IDps \nChOse theIr \nCurreNt \nl OC atION  BeC ause  OF \ngOOD  seCurIty IN\t\n46%\nOF sItes assesseD\t\naNBar  CrIsIs IDps \nChOse theIr  CurreNt \nl OC atION  BeCause OF  \nF amIly Or FrIeNDs IN  \nthe l OCatION  IN\n43%\nOF sItes assesseD\n\nDeMogRApHICS\t\nages 0-5 a\nges 6-24* a\nges 25-59 ages 60+\n11% 41%39% 9%\t\nassesseD aNBar CrIsIs IDps B y age  grOup\t\nmOst pOpul Ous\nVulNeraBIlItIes \namONg aNBar IDps \nIN  sItes assesseD\nChIlD  at rIsK\tIOm has assessed 616 locations in a pril and may which \ncontain 365,533 a nbar Crisis IDps.

Of the \ndistricts in a nbar; Fallujah, heet, r amadi, and haditha showed a particularly high proportion of sites with \npoor access to toilet facilities.  \nOf the IDp population who sought refuge with host families, the majority (87%) were living in sites that \nclaimed to not have access to separate toilets in residences.  this is particularly pertinent in a nbar and \nBaghdad. Overall, 372 of the 616 assessed sites reported that IDp s did not have access to separate toilets \nand showers in residences, and within these sites it was identified that IDp s occupied a range of settlement \ntypes; however, 48% of the IDp s accommodated within these sites were living with host families with the \nmajority residing in a nbar and Baghdad, 85% and 12% respectively. \nm ost IDp s did not have access to hygiene items in 27% of sites assessed, and 30% of sites reported that \nfemale IDp s did not have access to sanitary napkins and other hygiene materials.  the governorates of \na nbar, Baghdad, sulaymaniyah and Kerbala had particularly poor access to sanitation and hygiene items.\n\nWATeR, SAnITATIon,   AnD HygIene\t\n21\tDtm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\ngOVerNOrate # of sites \nassessed # of sites where a\nnbar IDps did \nnot have access to sufficient  sanitation\/hygiene items # of sites where a\nnbar IDp women \nand girls did not have access to sani- tary napkins and hygiene material\na nbar 116 64 55\nBabylon378 6\nBaghdad169 18 34\nBasrah82 1\nDahuk 281 -\nDiyala 81 -\nerbil 29- 2\nKerbala1615 15\nKirkuk163 2\nm issan 21 -\nNajaf 201 5\nNinewa 96 6\nQadissiya 91 4\ns alah al-Din 556 17\nsulaymaniyah6535 38\nthi Qar 113 1\nw assit 18 1 1\nI raQ 616166 187\ngOVerNOrate# of sites \nassessed # of sites where IDp\ns did not have \nsufficient quality drinking water # of sites without clean water available \nfor IDp s for needs other than drinking\nanbar 116 99 99\nBabylon37 - -\nBaghdad169 31 32\nBasrah8 - 1\nDahuk 28 - -\nDiyala 8 - -\nerbil 29 - -\nKerbala16 9 10\nKirkuk16 5 3\nm issan 2 1 -\nNajaf 20 7 1\nNinewa 9 4 1\nQadissiya 9 1 1\nsalah al-Din 55 16 18\nsulaymaniyah65 - -\nt hi Qar 11 1 -\nw assit 18 3 1\nI raQ 616 177 167\t\nhighest vulnerability governorates\n\nHeAlTH\nthe number of sites that reported non-functioning health centers has remained low through r ound III \nassessments. Of the 616 assessed sites through  round II and III, just 20% reported non-functioning health \nservices.  this was particularly noticeable in the governorates of a nbar and salah al-Din: 47% of sites with \nnon-functioning health services were in a nbar and 36% were in salah al-Din. Outside of a nbar, most \ncommonly, it was reported that these assessed sites did not have access to health facilities before the crisis \nbegan.  within a nbar, it was reported that medical personnel could not report to the health facilities for \nwork and that health facilities were reported to be located in an insecure area. excluding the governorates \nof a nbar and s alah al-Din, all other governorates reported that 94% of sites had access to functioning \nhealth facilities. \na lthough, generally, access to a functioning health facility is very good for IDp s affected by the anbar \nCrisis, the quality to the service provided varies. 55% of sites assessed in a pril and may reported that public \nhealth centers did not have adequate medical supplies.  this has slightly increased from 45% and 51% of the \nassessed sites in r ound I and II respectively, which may indicate a depletion of resources as displacement \nis prolonged.  the governorates of most concern are a nbar, salah al-Din and Baghdad as they held the \ngreatest number of displacement sites with health centers without adequate medical supplies. \nw hen the sites were assessed regarding available and adequate healthcare services for IDp women, 49% \nreported that there was not adequate access, most of which were in a nbar (districts of Fallujah, heet), \nBaghdad (districts of a l resafa, a bu ghraib, Karkh), s alah al-Din, and sulaymaniyah.   the most commonly \nreported health issue for IDp s in sites assessed was chronic illness.

In a pril \nand m ay, however, IDp children were not attending \nprimary school in 51% of sites assessed (316) and \nwere not attending secondary school in 52% of \nsites.  these sites were concentrated in the heet \nand  ramadi districts of  anbar, all districts of  salah \nal-Din, and sulaymaniyah district of sulaymaniyah.    \nOverall, the governorates of the Kurdistan r egion \nof Iraq (Dahuk, erbil, and sulaymaniyah), had very \npoor attendance rates. No sites in Dahuk had IDp s \nattending primary school, and only one location in \na medi district had IDp s attending secondary school. \nNone of the sites in erbil reported that IDp s were \nattending primary school and only 1 location in \nerbil district had IDp s attending secondary school.  \nNotably, in Baghdad, only 1 out of 169 locations \nassessed had IDp children not attending primary \nschools and in just 2 were they not attending \nsecondary school. \nInsufficient documentation was the most \ncommonly cited reason for non-attendance of \nprimary and secondary schools. Documentation \nissues were concentrated most heavily in the \ngovernorates of the Kurdistan r egion (Dahuk, erbil, \nsulaymaniyah) and s alah al-Din. another common \nreason hindering school attendance, particularly in \na nbar and s alah al-Din, was full schools. \nIn sulaymaniyah, after lack of documentation, \nthe distance to school and financial reasons were \nthe most commonly cited reasons preventing \nattendance.  IDp s were hindered from attending \nprimary and secondary school in s alah al-Din due \nto financial reasons, as well as reportedly not being \nallowed to attend. sites in erbil, notably, stated \nthat a language barrier was a top issue preventing \nattendance, as schools in erbil teach in Kurdish \nand a nbar Crisis IDp s speak arabic. Finally, a great  number of sites in a\nnbar stated that IDps were not \nattending primary or secondary schools for other \nreasons that were not specified. r eporting from \nthe field indicates that school attendance is low for \nseveral contributing reasons.  many schools have \nbeen damaged in the fighting, and people do not \nfeel that the security situation is stable enough to \nsend their kids to school. a s well, the large numbers \nof families living in schools is reportedly making it \nimpossible for students to continue their education \nin those sites.\na ccess to education is not only dependent \non children enrolling into schools but also on \nhaving access to school buildings. In 75 of 116 \nsites assessed in a nbar, more than 20,000 IDp s \nwere living in 162 schools. In 2 sites in  al-hawiga \nand Kirkuk districts of Kirkuk, 4 schools were \naccommodating 20 IDp s. Finally, in 6 locations \nin  tikrit district of  salah al-Din, 11 schools were \nhosting 100 a nbar Crisis IDp s. w hen the number of \nschools present in the location is compared to the \nnumber of schools IDp s are residing in, IDps were \noccupying 63% of available schools in these sites, \nhindering the ability of these schools to be used for \neducational purposes. Notably, none of the sites in \ns alah al-Din where IDp s were living in schools had \nIDp s attending primary or secondary schools. IDp s \nwere attending primary and secondary schools in \nonly 23 of the 76 sites in a nbar. \nt he need for education was not highly reported \nthrough the D tm. with the crisis just 5 months \nin and the majority of those displaced wishing to \nreturn then it seems that education is not currently \na top priority for IDp s. Of the assessed sites in \nDahuk, 30% of responses regarding assistance \nneeded noted educational support.  this aside, \nit was clear that education currently is not a high \npriority for IDp families throughout Iraq.\n\neDuCATIon\t\n24\tDtm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\t\nprImary sChOOl\t\nlack of sufficient \ndocuments\nOther\ns\nchool is \nfull Financial\nr\neasonsNot allowed\nDistance\t\n46%\nreasONs FOr NO\nt atteNDINg IN sItes assesseD\nseCONDary sChOOl 44%\n20 % 16%\n9 %\n9 %\n8 %\n8 %\n6 %\n6 %\n6 %\n9 %\t\ngOVerNOrate# of sites \nassessed # of sites where \nanbar IDp s \nwere living in  schools # of schools \nused to host  IDp s in sites \nassessed # of sites where \nIDp s were not \nattending \nprimary school # of sites where \nIDp s were not \nattending \nsecondary school\na nbar 11675 162 88 88\nBabylon 37- -10 11\nBaghdad 169- -1 2\nBasrah 8- -2 2\nDahuk 28- -28 27\nDiyala 8- -2 2\nerbil 29- -28 27\nKerbala 16- -15 16\nKirkuk 162 45 13\nm issan 2- -1 1\nNajaf 20- -- 1\nNinewa 9- -3 2\nQadissiya 9- -- -\nsalah al-Din 556 11 54 53\nsulaymaniyah 65- -58 59\nthi Qar 11- -7 6\nw assit 18- -14 12\nI raQ 61683 177 316 322\t\nhighest vulnerability governorates\n\nfooD\nuNaVaIlaBle  COmmODItIes  IN sItes assesseD*\t\naNBar CrIsIs IDps \nDID NOt ha Ve INF aNt \nCOmmODItIes \na VaIlaBle IN\t\n25\tD tm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\n*Word size is reflective of frequency of mention\n*Numerous sites had all commodities available, but were too expensive for IDPs to afford.

In Baghdad, \nspecifically, IDp s were required to provide documents issued in a nbar in order to register; however, many \nresidents of  anbar had their official documents issued in Baghdad over the last 20 years, causing difficulties \nto prove  anbar residency. \nIn just 8 of the 230 sites assessed outside of a nbar in may, it was reported that less than 25% of the a nbar \nCrisis IDp s in these sites were registered. a ll 8 sites had less than 30 IDp families in the site; these sites \nwere spread between Babylon, Baghdad, Basrah, Diyala, Kirkuk, and s alah al-Din. In 77 sites assessed \nthrough  round III in m ay, 25-75% of IDp s outside of anbar were registered in the location.  these sites were \nmost heavily concentrated in Baghdad and erbil. Despite some areas with low registration figures, more \nthan 75% of a nbar Crisis IDp s were registered in 142 sites assessed outside of a nbar in may; these sites \nwere primarily in Babylon, Baghdad, Dahuk, Najaf, Kerbala, and erbil. a s evidenced by the data collected, \nBaghdad has a large variety in the proportion of IDp s registered in its sites. al resafa district in particular \nholds most sites where IDp s had low levels of registration, and also holds many of the sites where 25-75% \nof IDp s were registered.\n\nASSISTAnCe\t\n32\tDtm r ound III (m ay 2014) - IOm Iraq - shelter\/NFI Cluster\t\nsItes haD reCeIVeD  \nNO  assIstaNCe\n120\t\nassIstaNCe NeeDeD  IN sItes assesseD*\n*Word size is reflective of frequency of mention\nwith the crisis continuing into a 6th month, the time \nthat families are displaced prolongs and the need for \nassistance remains paramount. a s the government, \nhC t and host communities respond to the crisis in aid \nof those displaced, of the 616 assessed sites through \nr ound II and r ound III of the D tm, 488 have received \nassistance, while 120 have not yet received any aid.\n423 had received NFI assistance and 366 had received food assistance. 88 sites had received cash \nassistance from government-led distributions, primarily focused in Baghdad, Kerbala, and  erbil. 56 sites \nhad received other financial assistance, and 34 had been in receipt of livelihood assistance. Currently, the \ndistribution of assistance reflects the dispersion of IDp s across Iraq. the governorates currently hosting \nthe most IDp s have received the majority of assistance: a nbar, Baghdad, and sulaymaniyah. Further to \nthis, the assistance that has been provided by all actors is responding well to the previous D tm findings, \nwhich concluded CrIs and food to be among the highest priority needs of those displaced. shelter was \nalso announced as a priority need and greater focus to support the shelter needs of IDp s would allow for \na more targeted response in relation to the previous need for assistance cited. \nOf the sites which had received assistance, it was reported that numerous actors have been part of the \nresponse. m ost commonly, assistance has been provided by the g overnment of Iraq. Interestingly, the \nnext most common providers were host community residents or family and friends. It is important to note \nthat as the crisis prolongs, the burden to assist the displaced may begin to have a detrimental impact on \nthe socioeconomic status of host community residents or the family and friends providing assistance. \na mong IDp s, round II and III found financial and NFI assistance as the two most pressing needs, but with \nfood, shelter and employment opportunities still remaining within the highest needs of those displaced. \nOverall \t\nand in view of the r ound III findings in consideration of previous round results, \nthe D tm revealed that financial assistance, core relief items (CrIs), shelter and food \nremain the highest priority needs among the displaced population.  these findings are in line with the \nhumanitarian needs identified within the  strategic  response  plan (srp). Following these needs, the D tm \nidentified many groups of individuals suffering from vulnerabilities who are in need of protection services. \nNonetheless, as detailed in the srp and with specific gaps identified through the D tm, a widespread \nresponse is needed, covering all sectors including health,  wash and education. \nOn the whole, a nbar is by far the most vulnerable governorate for its IDp population, succeeded by s alah \nal-Din, Baghdad, and sulaymaniyah.\n\nInfoRMATIon ReQueSTS:\t\nadditional information is available and will be provided upon written request.

IOM DTM aims to provide precise population dat\ta; how-\tever limited access and other operational constraints on the ground can limit information gathering activities.\t  \t\nThe Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is an International Organization for Migration (IOM) information manage-\nment  tool  that  gathers  specific  information  regarding  the  status  and  location  of  displaced  persons  across  the \ncountry.

Three  distinct  processes  are \t\npresently under way:  \t \t\n \t\nThe revised DTM methodology has expanded its field data collection. This includes a Group Assessment \nwith  Gender  Based  Violence  (GBV)  component  integrated  in  the  information  management  system  that \ngathers information through a network of Key Informants (KI) deployed at the location level (referred to as \nthe  \u00e2\u0080\u0098\tDTM\t Master  List  Plus\u00e2\u0080\u0099)\t.  These  tools  will  be  implemented  through  each  DTM  cycle  for  the  next  three \t\nmonths to  cover  all  locations  hosting displaced populations.  During  this period,  each  accessible  location \nwill  be  assessed  once  while  the  remaining  locations  will  be  monitored  and  updated  through  the  KI  net-\nwork. \t \t\n \n \nThe  Group  Assessment  and  GBV  Annex  will  add  further  clarity  to  the  data  in  terms  of  sex  and  age  dis-\naggregation, movement intentions,  push  factors,  sectorial  needs,  as well  as key  GBV  indicators. This re-\nvised  methodology  will  track displacement  at  the  group  level  by  monitoring  the  dynamics of specific  dis-\nplaced  populations\/groups  with  reference  to  their  place  of  origin,  period  of  displacement,  and  location\t-\t\nwise shelter arrangements in order to strengthen the analysis of the displacement trends across Iraq.\t \t\n \t\n \t\nA parallel process of reconciliation with the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster \nregarding the location and population hosted in IDPs camps is being implemented. \t \t\n \n \nFinally,  the  DTM  Shelter  Categories  have  been    revised  in  coordination  with  the  Shelter\/NFIs  Cluster, \nCCCM Cluster, and other sectorial partners, contributing to a joint approach for identifying  the conditions \nand needs of the displaced populations (please refer to Annex 3: DTM Shelter Definitions).\t \t\n \n \nA key output of this holistic approach is a significant shift in the reported populations per shelter type; the revised \nDTM dataset including the findings of the new assessment tools will be published during January, 2015.    \t \t\nThe current DTM data corresponds to three major waves of displacement in Iraq during2014; these are conven-\ntionally categorized by date: January to May, June to July, August to present, as indicated in Table and \t \t\nFigure 1\t3.  \t\n3Variance in the January to May, June to July, August to present, figures may occur between successive reports. Influencing \nfactors  include:  increased  accuracy  of  displacement  tracking,  continued  identification  of  previously  displaced  groups,  and inclusion  of  data  regarding  secondary  displacements  within  Iraq.  Displacement  populations  are  methodically  identified through  a  process  of  assessment,  verification  and  triangulation  of  data.  IOM  continues  to  closely  coordinate  with  regional and local authorities to maintain a shared, accurate understanding of displacement figures across Iraq.   \t \u00ef\u0083\u00a8\t  \u00ef\u0083\u00a8\t  \u00ef\u0083\u00a8\t  \u00ef\u0083\u00a8\n\n3\t \t\nIOM Response to the IDP Crisis in Iraq \t\u00ef\u0082\u009f 2014\t \t \t\nCONTACT\t \t IOM IRAQ \t \t \t\u00ef\u0080\u00aa iraqdtm@iom.int\t \t\n \t\n1ST WAVE\t \t\n2ND WAVE\t \t\n3TH WAVE\t \t\nGiven that 54% of the total 2014 displaced population has been recorded from 1\tst August to present (187,686 \t\nfamilies, estimated 1,126,116 individuals) and in light of the distinct displacement patterns monitored during re-\ncent  months,  four  observation  periods  have  been  introduced  in  order  to  enhance  data  analysis.

Figure 8 provides the comparison of in-\ntra  and  inter\t-governorate  displacement  for  2014,  highlighting  the  governorates  of  Anbar,  Baghdad,  Kirkuk  and \t\nDiyala  as  areas  which  are  mostly  affected  by  intra\t-governorate  displacements.  High  rates  of  intra\t-governorate \t\ndisplacements  are  reported  as  a  consequence  to  restricted  movements  and  tight  border  regulations  between \ngovernorates,  or  following  localized  conflict  that caused  populations  to displace  to  neighboring districts.  Family \nand tribal connections coupled with broader ethnic and religious affiliations are also factors that are reported to \ndetermine whether IDPs displace within their original governorates or seek protection in other governorates.\t \t\n3 DISPLACEMENT THROUGH THE REPORTING PERIO\tD \t \t\n4As detailed in the Annex 3, the following shelter categories are identified: CM (Camp); HC (Host Com-\nmunity); HM (Hotel\/ Motel); IS (Other Informal Settlements); RB (Religious Buildings); RH (Rented Hous-\nes); SB (School Buildings); UB (Unfinished and Abandoned Buildings); OT (Other Formal Settlements); \nand UN (Unknown).\t \t\nDuring the reporting period (25 November to 09 December) DTM field staff across Iraq recorded an additional \n82,290 displaced individuals. \t \t\n \nIn order to facilitate identifying the changes across the Shelter Categories following the recent data harmoniza-\ntion processes and improved DTM coverage as per revised methodology, Table 4 provides an overview of the \nvariances between this DTM round (9 December) and the previous one (25 November)\t4. \t\n \nThe new DTM shelter categories have split the Other\/Unknown category in two distinct groups: Other Collec-\ntive  Centers;  and  Unknown  (please  refer  to  Annex  3).

Further analysis at the district level \nreveals that as a consequence of continuous clashes in Al Hawiga district around 3,000 individuals have been \ndisplaced  to  bordering districts.  An  additional  2,200  individuals displaced  from  Anbar have  also  been record-\ned  as  enhanced  coverage  led  to  identification  of  populations  that  were  displaced  from  Salah  al\t-Din,  al  Alam \t\nand Baiji areas. The total volume of intra and inter governorate movements led to an increase of an estimated \n4,920  individuals  in  Daquq  and  5,270  individuals  in  Kirkuk  Center  districts.  Further  information  regarding  their \nshelter arrangements is presently being validated. \t \t\n \nMinor increases have also been reported from Anbar and Salah al\t-Din, both of them caused by displacement \t\nacross districts due to the prevailing insecurity situation. In Anbar, an increase of 3,234 individuals was record-\ned in Falluja and 450 individuals in Al\t-Rutba. For Salah al Din, there has been an increase of 2,550 individuals \t\nin Al\t-Fares district owing to continued violence in Al\t-Alam area, as well as recent clashes in Balad district.

At the same time, considerable \t\nmovements  between  shelter  arrangements  have  been  recorded,  thus  highlighting  the  ongoing  movement  from  School \nBuildings  (decrease  of  49,446  individuals)  and  Host  Community  (10,458  individuals)  to  Camps  and  Unfinished  \/  Aban-\ndoned  Buildings.  In  fact,  a  significant  increase  of  47,112  individuals  is  reported  in  the  latter  category  due  to  recent  data \nmanagement activities that are being further analyzed and validated.\t \t\nThe  decrease  in  the  Host Community  population  in  Ninewa  (16,284  individuals)  has  mainly  occurred  in the  district  of  Al\t-\t\nShikan, where population is reported to have moved to Unfinished\/ Abandoned Buildings and Camps in Dahuk.\t   \t\nThe displaced populations across Iraq have sought refuge within a range of shelter types. Many areas have be-\ncome  burdened  with  large  displaced  populations  hence  increasing  the  demand  for  shelter.  As  a  result,  a  large \nnumber  of  families  are  housed  in  inadequate  or  short\t-term  shelter  arrangements  that  are  unsuitable  for  winter \t\nconditions highlighting the critical need for assistance. \t \t\n \nPopulations  of  concern  are  those  who  have  found  refuge  in  more  vulnerable  shelter  arrangements  and  are  not \nhosted or living in hotels or rented accommodation.

The DTM is adapta-\nble.  The  tool  provides  a  continual,  up  to  date  snapshot  of  displacement  sites  and  populations;  however,  lo-\ncation  access  and  security  limitations  must  be  considered  alongside  the  massive,  complex  and  fluid  nature \nof the current displacement observed in Iraq.\t \t\n \n \nThe DTM methodology is two\t-fold and contained within a continual cycle that ensures a frequent, up to date \t\nsnap shot of displacement:\t \t\n \t\n1. Stage  I:\t IOM  field  monitors  identify  the  location  of  displaced  populations  through  an  established  net-\t\nwork of community\t-level key informants.\t \t\n2. Stage II:\t A second more detailed key informant assessment is conducted to gain a better understand-\t\ning of the situation at the community level.\t \t\n \n \t\nIOM  key  informants  include: \tcommunity  leaders,  mukhtars,  local  authorities,  and  security  forces.  Additional \t\ninformation  is  gathered  from  government  registration  data  and  partner  agencies.  The  two  stage  process  is \ncyclical,  and  designed  to  effectively  track  the  continued  movement  trends  of  displaced  populations  at  the \nlocation, district, governorate and national level as the situation evolves.\t \t\n \n \n \nWhen Access is limited\t \t\n \nWhen  IOM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Rapid  Assessment  and  Response  Teams  (RART)  are  unable  to  access  a  community,  the  first \nstage of DTM is extended while the second stage is put on hold. This is called DTM Stage 1 Plus\t. \t\n \nStage 1 Plus\t continues to identify the location of displaced populations, and in addition, the assessment col-\t\nlects specific key information. This includes shelter type occupied, access to services, needs and assistance \nreceived.  This method\t was first  deployed  in  Anbar  in  early  2014  and  later  in  the  central  governorates  of Iraq \t\nas  the  security  situation  rapidly  deteriorated  in  June.
